Recently, I was interviewed by [Francesco](https://twitter.com/FrancescoD_Ales) from [Keep Productive](), a vlog about productivity and the tools we use to achieve it. We walked through my current Notion setup, including a board I use to track my day-to-day tasks, my expansive Recipe Box and grocery shopping strategy, among many other things. This blog post will serve to walk you through those setups, and provide links to the resources I mentioned in the video.

## The Templates

I covered a number of approaches in this 40 minute interview. I will cover each template independently, starting with my Basecamp. This "Basecamp" is comprised of two different main boards: a To-Do Tracker and a [Master Schedule](#master-schedule).
