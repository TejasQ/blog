# ML on the CL

#### _(a.k.a. Machine Learning on the Command Line)_

In [June of 2018](https://www.meetup.com/Los-Angeles-JavaScript-and-Node-js/events/slfcbpyxjblc/), I gave a talk about building node bots that utilize machine learning via a variety of publicly available packages, with many of the examples being executed from the command line.

I covered a few different types of machine learning in this talk:

1. One thing

2. Two thing

3. Red thing

4. Blue thing

Thank you for having me, [js.la](https://js.la)!
